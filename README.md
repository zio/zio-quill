# ZIO Quill

Quill provides a Quoted Domain Specific Language ([QDSL](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/wadler/papers/qdsl/qdsl.pdf)) to express queries in Scala and execute them in a target language.

## Introduction

The library's core is designed to support multiple target languages, currently featuring specializations for Structured Query Language ([SQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL)) and Cassandra Query Language ([CQL](https://cassandra.apache.org/doc/latest/cql/)).

1. **Boilerplate-free mapping**: The database schema is mapped using simple case classes.
2. **Quoted DSL**: Queries are defined inside a `quote` block. Quill parses each quoted block of code (quotation) at compile time and translates them to an internal Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)
3. **Compile-time query generation**: The `ctx.run` call reads the quotation's AST and translates it to the target language at compile time, emitting the query string as a compilation message. As the query string is known at compile time, the runtime overhead is very low and similar to using the database driver directly.
4. **Compile-time query validation**: If configured, the query is verified against the database at compile time and the compilation fails if it is not valid. The query validation **does not** alter the database state.

> ### Scala 3 Support
> [ProtoQuill](https://github.com/zio/zio-protoquill) provides Scala 3 support for Quill rebuilding on top of new metaprogramming capabilities from the ground > up! It is published to maven-central as the `quill-<module>_3` line of artifacts.

> ### Doobie Support
> See [here](contexts.md#quill-doobie) for Doobie integration instructions.

## Acknowledgement

The project was created having Philip Wadler's talk ["A practical theory of language-integrated query"](https://www.infoq.com/presentations/theory-language-integrated-query) as its initial inspiration. The development was heavily influenced by the following papers:

* [A Practical Theory of Language-Integrated Query](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/slindley/papers/practical-theory-of-linq.pdf)
* [Everything old is new again: Quoted Domain Specific Languages](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/wadler/papers/qdsl/qdsl.pdf)
