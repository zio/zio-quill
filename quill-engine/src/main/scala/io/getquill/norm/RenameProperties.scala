/**
 * Rename properties now relies on the Quats themselves to propagate field
 * renames. The previous iterations of this phase relied on schema propagation
 * via stateful transforms holding field-renames which were then compared to
 * Property AST elements. This was a painstakingly complex and highly
 * error-prone especially when embedded objects were used requiring computation
 * of sub-schemas in a process called 'schema protraction'. The new variation of
 * this phase relies on the Quats directly since the Quats of every Identity,
 * Lift, etc... now know what the field-names contained therein as well as the
 * sub-Quats of any embedded property. This is fairly simple process:
 *
 * <ul> <li> Learning what Quats have which renames is simple since this can be
 * propagated from the Quats of the Entity objects, to the rest of the AST. <li>
 * This has the simple requirement that renames must be propagated fully before
 * they are actually committed so that the knowledge of what needs to be renamed
 * into what can be distributed easily throughout the AST. <li> Once these
 * future-renames are staged to Quats throught the AST, a simple stateless
 * reduction will then apply the renames to the Property AST elements around the
 * Ident's (and potentially Lifts etc...) with the renamed Quats. </ul>
 *
 * The entire process above can be done with a series of stateless
 * transformations with straighforward operations since the majority of the
 * logic actually lives within the Quats themselves.
