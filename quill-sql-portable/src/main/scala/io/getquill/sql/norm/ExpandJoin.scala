/**
 * This phase expands inner joins adding the correct aliases so they will function. Unfortunately,
 * since it introduces aliases into the clauses that don't actually exist in the inner expressions,
 * it is not technically type-safe but will not result in a Quat error since Quats cannot check
 * for Ident scoping. For a better implementation, that uses a well-typed FlatMap/FlatJoin cascade, have
 * a look here:
 * [[https://gist.github.com/deusaquilus/dfb42880656df12779a0afd4f20ef1bb Better Typed ExpandJoin which uses FlatMap/FlatJoin]]
 *
 * The reason the above implementation is not currently used is because `ExpandNestedQueries` does not
 * yet use Quat fields for expansion. Once this is changed, using that implementation here
 * should be reconsidered.
