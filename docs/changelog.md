Starting from the versions superior v4.6.1, the release notes and changelog will be provided in the GitHub Releases of the project.
See https://github.com/zio/zio-quill/releases

# 4.6.1

- [Remove support of Scala 2.11 && Update ZIO to 2.0.12](https://github.com/zio/zio-quill/pull/2722)
  - Remove support of Scala 2.11
  - Update Scala versions
  - Update ZIO to 2.0.12
  - Update zio-logging to 2.1.12
  - Update sbt to 1.7.3
  - Update sbt-scoverage to 2.0.0
  - Update zio-json to 0.5.0

#### Notes:
- Besides for Scala-version support update and the dependency bumps (thank you Guizmaii and Juliano!) the purpose of this
  release is to set the stage of future infrastructure changes e.g. adding Scalafmt to do formatting instead
  of the long-standing scalariform.

# 4.6.0

- [Implementing Postgres json/jsonb encoding via zio-json](https://github.com/zio/zio-quill/pull/2615)

# 4.5.0

- [Remove the need to make things embedded, happens automatically](https://github.com/zio/zio-quill/pull/2607)
- [Date encoders for major date types. Extensible context.](https://github.com/zio/zio-quill/pull/2598)
- [Warning about embedding fields that should have encoders](https://github.com/zio/zio-quill/pull/2610)
- [jasync zio current schema configuration, jasync version  update](https://github.com/zio/zio-quill/pull/2588)

#### Migration Notes:
- It is no longer necessary to do extend `Embedded` for case classes that should be embedded within an entity.
  In the case that the embedded case class "looks" like it should be encoded/decoded (i.e. it has only one field),
  an additional warning has been introduced to notify the user of this potential issue.

# 4.4.1

- [Fixing VALUES-clause update query naming](https://github.com/zio/zio-quill/pull/2595)

# 4.4.0

- [UPDATE with VALUES optimization for Postgres. Various macro refactoring.](https://github.com/zio/zio-quill/pull/2571)

# 4.3.0

- [Values clause batch insert](https://github.com/zio/zio-quill/pull/2565)
- [Slightly better batch logging](https://github.com/zio/zio-quill/pull/2562)
- ["transaction" supports ZIO effects with mixed environments](https://github.com/zio/zio-quill/pull/2515)

# 4.2.0

- [Implement ZIO-Idiomatic JDBC Context](https://github.com/zio/zio-quill/pull/2537)
- [Update idiomatic pattern based on discussions](https://github.com/zio/zio-quill/pull/2546)
- [Implement ZIO idiomatic pattern for cassandra](https://github.com/zio/zio-quill/pull/2549)
- [Add switch to manually disable returning/output-clauses](https://github.com/zio/zio-quill/pull/2550)
- [cassandra - update if exists](https://github.com/zio/zio-quill/pull/2359)

- [Remove mysql as](https://github.com/zio/zio-quill/pull/2540)

#### Migration Notes:
- The `infix` interpolator is now deprecated because in Scala 2, infix is a keyword. Instead of
  `infix"MyUdf(${person.name})"` use `sql"MyUdf(${person.name})"`. For contexts such as Doobie that already
  have an `sql` interpolator. Import `context.compat._` and use the `qsql` interpolator instead.

#### Migration Notes:
- As a result of [2504](https://github.com/zio/zio-quill/pull/2504), the handling of optional-product rows (technically parts of rows) is now different. Whereas before, if any non-optional column of an optional-product row was null, then entre optional-product would be null. Now however, an optional-product will only be null if every column inside is null. For example, before, if a query returning `Person(name:Option(Name(first:String, last:String)), age: Int)` resulted in the row `ResultRow("Joe", null, 123)` before the entity would be decoded into `Person(None, 123)` (i.e. the optional-product `Option[Name]` would decode to `None`).<br />
  Now however, `Option[Name]` only decodes to `None` if every column inside it is null. This means that the `ResultRow("Joe", null, 123)` decodes to `Person(Name("Joe", 0 /*default-placeholder for null*/), 123)`. Only when the both `first` and `last` columns in Name are null i.e. `ResultRow(null, null, 123)` will the result be: `Person(None, 123)`. Have a look at the PR [2504](https://github.com/zio/zio-quill/pull/2504) as well as it's corresponding issue [2505](https://github.com/zio/zio-quill/issues/2505) for more details on how this works and the rationale for it.

#### Migration Notes
* The method `EntityQuery.insert(CaseClass)` e.g. `query[Person].insert(Person("Joe", 123))` has been replaced with `insertValue`.
  The original `insert` method has been deprecated and will be removed in the next Quill release.
* The `quill-async` modules using Mauricio's deprecated library ([here](https://github.com/mauricio/postgresql-async))
  have been removed. Please move to the `quill-jasync` libraries as soon as possible.
* Quill for ScalaJS has been updated to ScalaJS 1.8.
* `quill-core-portable` and `quill-sql-portable` are now merged into a cross-built `quill-engine` module.
* In 3.12.0 addition of field-aliases has been introduced in sub-queries but [#2340](https://github.com/zio/zio-quill/issues/2340)
  then occurred. A compile-time switch `-Dquill.query.subexpand=false` has been introduced to disable the feature
  until it can be fixed.

#### Migration Notes - Datastax Drivers:

The Datastax drivers have been moved to Version 4, this adds support for many new features with the caveat that the configuration
file format must be changed. In Version 4, the Datastax standard configuration file format and properties
are in the HOCON format. They are used to configure the driver.

Sample HOCON:
```hocon
MyCassandraDb {
  preparedStatementCacheSize=1000
  keyspace=quill_test

  session {
    basic.contact-points = [ ${?CASSANDRA_CONTACT_POINT_0}, ${?CASSANDRA_CONTACT_POINT_1} ]
    basic.load-balancing-policy.local-datacenter = ${?CASSANDRA_DC}
    basic.request.consistency = LOCAL_QUORUM
    basic.request.page-size = 3
  }

}
```

The `session` entry values and keys are described in the datastax documentation:
[Reference configuration](https://docs.datastax.com/en/developer/java-driver/4.13/manual/core/configuration/reference/)


The ZioCassandraSession constructors:

```scala
 val zioSessionLayer: ZLayer[Any, Throwable, CassandraZioSession] =
  CassandraZioSession.fromPrefix("MyCassandraDb")
run(query[Person])
  .provideCustomLayer(zioSessionLayer)
```

Additional parameters can be added programmatically:
```scala
 val zioSessionLayer: ZLayer[Any, Throwable, CassandraZioSession] =
  CassandraZioSession.fromContextConfig(LoadConfig("MyCassandraDb").withValue("keyspace", ConfigValueFactory.fromAnyRef("data")))
run(query[Person])
  .provideCustomLayer(zioSessionLayer)
```


`session.queryOptions.fetchSize=N` config entry should be replaced by
`basic.request.page-size=N`

```hocon
testStreamDB {
  preparedStatementCacheSize=1000
  keyspace=quill_test

  session {
    ...
    basic.request.page-size = 3
  }
  ...
}
```

#### Migration Notes - Query Log File:

Production of the query-log file `queries.txt` has been disabled by default due to issues with SBT
and metals. In order to use it, launch the compiler JVM (e.g. SBT) with the argument `-Dquill.log.file=my_queries.sql`
or set the `quill_log_file` environment variable (e.g. `export quill_log_file=my_queries.sql`).

#### Migration Notes - Monix:

The monix context wrapper `MonixJdbcContext.Runner` has been renamed to `MonixJdbcContext.EffectWrapper`.
The type `Runner` needs to be used by ProtoQuill to define quill-context-specific execution contexts.

# 3.11.0

- [Implement `transaction` on outer zio-jdbc-context using fiber refs](https://github.com/getquill/quill/pull/2302)
- [Feature Request: write compile-time queries to a file](https://github.com/getquill/quill/issues/1715)
- [`transaction` supports ZIO effects with mixed environments](https://github.com/getquill/quill/pull/2304)
- [Apple M1 Build Updates & Instructions](https://github.com/getquill/quill/pull/2296)

#### Migration Notes:

All ZIO JDBC context `run` methods have now switched from have switched their dependency (i.e. `R`) from `Connection` to
`DataSource`. This should clear up many innocent errors that have happened because how this `Connection` is supposed
to be provided was unclear. As I have come to understand, nearly all DAO service patterns involve grabbing a connection from a
pooled DataSource, doing one single crud operation, and then returning the connection back to the pool. The new JDBC ZIO context
memorialize this pattern.

* The signature of `QIO[T]` has been changed from `ZIO[Connection, SQLException, T]` to `ZIO[DataSource, SQLException, T]`.
  a new type-alias `QCIO[T]` (lit. Quill Connection IO) has been introduced that represents `ZIO[Connection, SQLException, T]`.

* If you are using the `.onDataSource` command, migration should be fairly easy. Whereas previously, a usage of quill-jdbc-zio 3.10.0
  might have looked like this:
  ```scala
  object MyPostgresContext extends PostgresZioJdbcContext(Literal); import MyPostgresContext._
  val zioDS = DataSourceLayer.fromPrefix("testPostgresDB")

  val people = quote {
    query[Person].filter(p => p.name == "Alex")
  }

  MyPostgresContext.run(people).onDataSource
    .tap(result => printLine(result.toString))
    .provideCustomLayer(zioDs)
  ```
  In 3.11.0 simply remove the `.onDataSource` in order to use the new context.
  ```scala
  object MyPostgresContext extends PostgresZioJdbcContext(Literal); import MyPostgresContext._
  val zioDS = DataSourceLayer.fromPrefix("testPostgresDB")

  val people = quote {
    query[Person].filter(p => p.name == "Alex")
  }

  MyPostgresContext.run(people)  // Don't need `.onDataSource` anymore
    .tap(result => printLine(result.toString))
    .provideCustomLayer(zioDs)
  ```

* If you are creating a Hikari DataSource directly, passing of the dependency is now also simpler. Instead having to pass
  the Hikari-pool-layer into `DataSourceLayer`, just provide the Hikari-pool-layer directly.

  From this:
  ```scala
  def hikariConfig = new HikariConfig(JdbcContextConfig(LoadConfig("testPostgresDB")).configProperties)
  def hikariDataSource: DataSource with Closeable = new HikariDataSource(hikariConfig)

  val zioConn: ZLayer[Any, Throwable, Connection] =
    Task(hikariDataSource).toLayer >>> DataSourceLayer.live


  MyPostgresContext.run(people)
    .tap(result => printLine(result.toString))
    .provideCustomLayer(zioConn)
  ```
  To this:
  ```scala
  def hikariConfig = new HikariConfig(JdbcContextConfig(LoadConfig("testPostgresDB")).configProperties)
  def hikariDataSource: DataSource with Closeable = new HikariDataSource(hikariConfig)

  val zioDS: ZLayer[Any, Throwable, DataSource] =
    Task(hikariDataSource).toLayer // Don't need `>>> DataSourceLayer.live` anymore!

  MyPostgresContext.run(people)
    .tap(result => printLine(result.toString))
    .provideCustomLayer(zioConn)
  ```

* If you want to provide a `java.sql.Connection` to a ZIO context directly, you can still do it using the `underlying` variable.
  ```
  object Ctx extends PostgresZioJdbcContext(Literal); import MyPostgresContext._
  Ctx.underlying.run(qr1)
    .provide(zio.Has(conn: java.sql.Connection))
  ```

* Also, when using an underlying context, you can still use `onDataSource` to go from a `Connection` dependency
  back to a `DataSource` dependency (note that it no longer has to be `with Closable`).
  ```
    object Ctx extends PostgresZioJdbcContext(Literal); import MyPostgresContext._
    Ctx.underlying.run(qr1)
      .onDataSource
      .provide(zio.Has(ds: java.sql.DataSource))
    ```

* Finally, that the `prepare` methods have been unaffected by this change. They still require a `Connection`
  and have the signature `ZIO[Connection, SQLException, PreparedStatement]`. This is because in order to work
  with the result of this value (i.e. to work with `PreparedStatement`), the connection that created it must
  still be open.

# 3.10.0

- [Defunct AsyncZioCache accidentally returned in #2174. Remove it.](https://github.com/getquill/quill/pull/2246)
- [Open connection on ZIO blocking pool](https://github.com/getquill/quill/pull/2244)
- [Line-up core API with ProtoQuill so child contexts can have same code](https://github.com/getquill/quill/pull/2231)

#### Migration Notes:

No externally facing API changes have been made.
This release aligns Quill's internal Context methods with the API defined in ProtoQuill and introduces
a root-level context (in the `quill-sql-portable` module) that will be shared together with ProtoQuill.
Two arguments `info: ExecutionInfo` and `dc: DatasourceContext` have been introduced to all `execute___`
and `prepare___` methods. For Scala2-Quill, these arguments should be ignored as they contain no
relevant information. ProtoQuill uses them in order to pass Ast information as well as whether
the query is Static or Dynamic into execute and prepare methods. In the future, Scala2-Quill may be enhanced
to use them as well.

# 3.9.0

- [Pass Session to all Encoders/Decoders allowing UDT Encoding without local session variable in contexts e.g. ZIO and others](https://github.com/getquill/quill/pull/2219)
- [Fixing on-conflict case with querySchema/schemaMeta renamed columns](https://github.com/getquill/quill/pull/2218)

#### Migration Notes:

This release modifies Quill's core encoding DSL however this is very much an internal API.
If you are using MappedEncoder, which should be the case for most users, you will be completely unaffected.
The MappedEncoder signatures remain the same.

Quill's core encoding API has changed:
```scala
// From:
type BaseEncoder[T] = (Index, T, PrepareRow) => PrepareRow
type BaseDecoder[T] = (Index, ResultRow) => T
// To:
type BaseEncoder[T] = (Index, T, PrepareRow, Session) => PrepareRow
type BaseDecoder[T] = (Index, ResultRow, Session) => T
```
That means that internal signature of all encoders has also changed. For example, the JdbcEncoder has changed:
```scala
// From:
case class JdbcEncoder[T](sqlType: Int, encoder: BaseEncoder[T]) extends BaseEncoder[T] {
  override def apply(index: Index, value: T, row: PrepareRow) =
    encoder(index + 1, value, row)
}
// To:
case class JdbcEncoder[T](sqlType: Int, encoder: BaseEncoder[T]) extends BaseEncoder[T] {
  override def apply(index: Index, value: T, row: PrepareRow, session: Session) =
    encoder(index + 1, value, row, session)
}
```
If you are writing encoders that directly implement `BaseEncoder`, they will have to be modified with an
additional `session: Session` parameter.
> The actual type that `Session` is will vary. For JDBC this will be `Connection`, for `Cassandra` this will be some
implementation of `CassandraSession`, for other systems that use a entirely different session paradigm
this will just be `Unit`.

Again, if you are using MappedEncoders for all of your custom encoding needs, you will not be affected by this change.

# 3.8.0

- [Use ZIO-Native Iterator chunking for JDBC result sets](https://github.com/getquill/quill/pull/2196)
- [Remove 'with Blocking' from all signatures](https://github.com/getquill/quill/pull/2174)
- [Update Microsoft SQL Server Docker image](https://github.com/getquill/quill/pull/2183)

#### Migration Notes:
The `quill-jdbc-zio` contexts' `.run` method was designed to work with ZIO in an idiomatic way. As such, the environment variable
of their return type including the `zio.blocking.Blocking` dependency. This added a significant amount of complexity.
Instead of `ZIO[Connection, SQLException, T]`, the return type became `ZIO[Connection with Blocking, SQLException, T]`.
Instead of `ZIO[DataSource with Closeable, SQLException, T]`, the return type became `ZIO[DataSource with Closeable with Blocking, SQLException, T]`.
Various types such as `QConnection` and `QDataSource` were created in order to encapsulate these concepts but this only led to additional confusion.
Furthermore, actually supplying a `Connection` or `DataSource with Closeable` required first peeling off the `with Blocking` clause, calling a `.provide`,
and then appending it back on. The fact that a Connection needs to be opened from a Data Source (which will typically be a Hikari connection pool)
further complicates the problem because this aforementioned process needs to be done twice. All of leads to the clear conclusion that the `with Blocking`
construct has bad ergonomics. For this reason, the ZIO team has decided to drop the concept of `with Blocking` in ZIO 2 altogether.

As a result of this, I have decided to drop the `with Blocking` construct in advance. Quill queries resulting from the `run(qry)` command and
still run on the blocking pool but `with Blocking` is not included in the signature. This also means that and the need for `QConnection` and `QDataSource` disappears since they are now just `Connection` and `Datasource with Closeable`
respectively. This also means that all the constructors on the corresponding objects e.g. `QDataSource.fromPrefix("myDB")` are not consistent with
any actual construct in QIO, therefore they are not needed either.

Instead, I have introduced a simple layer-constructor called `DataSourceLayer` which has a `.live` implementation which converts
`ZIO[Connection, SQLException, T]` to `ZIO[DataSource with Closeable, SQLException, T]` by taking a connection from the
data-source and returning it immediately afterward, this is the analogue of what `QDataSource.toConnection` use to do.
You can use it like this:
```scala
def hikariDataSource: DataSource with Closeable = ...
val zioConn: ZLayer[Any, Throwable, Connection] =
  Task(hikariDataSource).toLayer >>> DataSourceLayer.live
run(people)
  .provideCustomLayer(zioConn)
```

You can also use the extension method `.onDataSource` (or `.onDS` for short) to do the same thing:
```scala
def hikariDataSource: DataSource with Closeable = ...
run(people)
  .onDataSource
  .provide(Has(hikariDataSource))
```

Also, constructor-methods `fromPrefix`, `fromConfig`, `fromJdbcConfig` and `fromDataSource` are available on
`DataSourceLayer` to construct instances of `ZLayer[DataSource with Closeable, SQLException, Connection]`.
Combined with the `toDataSource` construct, these provide a simple way to construct various Hikari pools from
a corresponding typesafe-config file `application.conf`.
```scala
run(people)
  .onDataSource
  .provideLayer(DataSourceLayer.fromPrefix("testPostgresDB"))
```

Also note that the objects `QDataSource` and `QConnection` have not yet been removed. Instead, all of their methods
have been marked as deprecated and a comment on what calls using `DataSourceLayer`/`onDataSource` to use instead
have been added.

#### Cassandra:

Similar changes have been made in quill-cassandra-zio. `CassandraZioSession with Blocking` has been replaced
with just `CassandraZioSession` so now this is much easier to provide:

```scala
val session: CassandraZioSession = _
run(people)
  .provide(Has(session))
```

The CassandraZioSession constructors however are all still fine to use:

```scala
 val zioSessionLayer: ZLayer[Any, Throwable, CassandraZioSession] =
   CassandraZioSession.fromPrefix("testStreamDB")
run(query[Person])
  .provideCustomLayer(zioSessionLayer)
```

Migration Notes:
In order to properly accommodate a good ZIO experience, several refactorings had to be done to various
internal context classes, none of these changes modify class structure in a breaking way.

The following was done for quill-jdbc-zio
- Query Preparation base type definitions have been moved out of `JdbcContextSimplified` into `JdbcContextBase`
  which inherits a class named `StagedPrepare` which defines prepare-types (e.g. `type PrepareQueryResult = Session => Result[PrepareRow]`).
- This has been done so that the ZIO JDBC Context can define prepare-types via the ZIO `R` parameter instead of
  a lambda parameter (e.g. `ZIO[QConnection, SQLException, PrepareRow]` a.k.a. `QIO[PrepareRow]`).
- In order prevent user-facing breaking changes. The contexts in `BaseContexts.scala` now extend from both `JdbcContextSimplified` (indirectly)
  and `JdbcContextBase` thus preserving the `Session => Result[PrepareRow]` prepare-types.
- The context `JdbcContextSimplified` now contains the `prepareQuery/Action/BatchAction` methods used by all contexts other than the ZIO
  contexts which define these methods independently (since they use the ZIO `R` parameter).
- All remaining context functionality (i.e. the `run(...)` series of functions) has been extracted out into `JdbcRunContext` which the
  ZIO JDBC Contexts in `ZioJdbcContexts.scala` as well as all the other JDBC Contexts now extend.

Similarly for quill-cassandra-zio
- The CassandraSessionContext on which the CassandraMonixContext and all the other Cassandra contexts are based on keeps internal state (i.e. session, keyspace, caches).
- This state was pulled out as separate classes e.g. `SyncCache`, `AsyncFutureCache` (the ZIO equivalent of which is `AsyncZioCache`).
- Then a `CassandraZioSession` is created which extends these state-containers however, it is not directly a base-class of the `CassandraZioContext`.
- Instead it is returned as a dependency from the CassandraZioContext run/prepare commands as part of the type
  `ZIO[CassandraZioSession with Blocking, Throwable, T]` (a.k.a `CIO[T]`). This allows the primary context CassandraZioContext to be stateless.

# 3.6.1

- [Memoize Passed-By-Name Quats of Asts Ident, Entity, and Others](https://github.com/getquill/quill/pull/2084)
- [Minor Quat Fixes and More Tests](https://github.com/getquill/quill/pull/2057)

Migration Notes:

 - Memoization of Quats should improve performance of dynamic queries based on some profiling analysis. This
   change should not have any user-facing changes.

# 3.6.0
This description is an aggregation of the 3.6.0-RC1, RC2 and RC3 as well as several new items.

 - [Quat Enhancements to Support Needed Spark Use Cases](https://github.com/getquill/quill/pull/2010)
 - [Add support for scala 2.13 to quill-cassandra-lagom](https://github.com/getquill/quill/pull/1909)
 - [Change all Quat fields to Lazy](https://github.com/getquill/quill/pull/2004)
 - [Smart serialization based on number of Quat fields](https://github.com/getquill/quill/pull/1997)
 - [Better Dynamic Query DSL For Quats on JVM](https://github.com/getquill/quill/pull/1993)
 - [Fix incorrect Quat.Value parsing issues](https://github.com/getquill/quill/pull/1987)
 - [Fix Query in Nested Operation and Infix](https://github.com/getquill/quill/pull/1980)
 - [Fix Logic table, replicate Option.getOrElse optimization to Boolean Quats](https://github.com/getquill/quill/pull/1975)
 - [Fixes + Enhancements to Boolean Optional APIs](https://github.com/getquill/quill/pull/1970)
 - [Fix for Boolean Quat Issues](https://github.com/getquill/quill/pull/1967)

Migration Notes:

 - The Cassandra base UDT class `io.getquill.context.cassandra.Udt` has been moved to `io.getquill.Udt`.
 - When working with databases which do not support boolean literals (SQL Server, Oracle, etc...) infixes representing booleans
   will be converted to equality-expressions.

   For example:
   ```
   query[Person].filter(p => sql"isJoe(p.name)".as[Boolean])
   // SELECT ... FROM Person p WHERE isJoe(p.name)
   // Becomes> SELECT ... FROM Person p WHERE 1 = isJoe(p.name)
   ```
   This is because the aforementioned databases do not directly support boolean literals (i.e. true/false) or expressions
   that yield them.

   In some cases however, it is desirable for the above behavior not to happen and for the whole infix statement to be treated
   as an expression. For example
   ```
   query[Person].filter(p => sql"${p.age} > 21".as[Boolean])
   // We Need This> SELECT ... FROM Person p WHERE p.age > 21
   // Not This> SELECT ... FROM Person p WHERE 1 = p.age > 21
   ```
   In order to have this behavior, instead of `sql"...".as[Boolean]`, use `sql"...".asCondition`.
   ```
   query[Person].filter(p => sql"${p.age} > 21".asCondition)
   // We Need This> SELECT ... FROM Person p WHERE p.age > 21
   ```
   If the condition represents a pure function, be sure to use `sql"...".pure.asCondition`.


# 3.6.0-RC3

 - [Add support for scala 2.13 to quill-cassandra-lagom](https://github.com/getquill/quill/pull/1909)
 - [Change all Quat fields to Lazy](https://github.com/getquill/quill/pull/2004)
 - [Smart serialization based on number of Quat fields](https://github.com/getquill/quill/pull/1997)
 - [Better Dynamic Query DSL For Quats on JVM](https://github.com/getquill/quill/pull/1993)

# 3.6.0-RC2

- [Fix incorrect Quat.Value parsing issues](https://github.com/getquill/quill/pull/1987)

Migration Notes:

 - When working with databases which do not support boolean literals (SQL Server, Oracle, etc...) infixes representing booleans
   will be converted to equality-expressions.

   For example:
   ```
   query[Person].filter(p => sql"isJoe(p.name)".as[Boolean])
   // SELECT ... FROM Person p WHERE isJoe(p.name)
   // Becomes> SELECT ... FROM Person p WHERE 1 = isJoe(p.name)
   ```
   This is because the aforementioned databases do not directly support boolean literals (i.e. true/false) or expressions
   that yield them.

   In some cases however, it is desirable for the above behavior not to happen and for the whole infix statement to be treated
   as an expression. For example
   ```
   query[Person].filter(p => sql"${p.age} > 21".as[Boolean])
   // We Need This> SELECT ... FROM Person p WHERE p.age > 21
   // Not This> SELECT ... FROM Person p WHERE 1 = p.age > 21
   ```
   In order to have this behavior, instead of `sql"...".as[Boolean]`, use `sql"...".asCondition`.
   ```
   query[Person].filter(p => sql"${p.age} > 21".asCondition)
   // We Need This> SELECT ... FROM Person p WHERE p.age > 21
   ```
   If the condition represents a pure function, be sure to use `sql"...".pure.asCondition`.
 - This release is not binary compatible with any Quill version before 3.5.3.
 - Any code generated by the Quill Code Generator with `quote { ... }` blocks will have to be regenerated with this
   Quill version if generated before 3.5.3.
 - In most SQL dialects (i.e. everything except Postgres) boolean literals and expressions yielding them are
    not supported so statements such as `SELECT foo=bar FROM ...` are not supported. In order to get equivalent logic,
    it is necessary to user case-statements e.g.
    ```sql
    SELECT CASE WHERE foo=bar THEN 1 ELSE 0`.
    ```
    On the other hand, in a WHERE-clause, it is the opposite:
    ```sql
    SELECT ... WHERE CASE WHEN (...) foo ELSE bar`
    ```
    is invalid and needs to be rewritten.
    Naively, a `1=` could be inserted:
    ```sql
    SELECT ... WHERE 1 = (CASE WHEN (...) foo ELSE bar)
    ```
    Note that this behavior can disabled via the `-Dquill.query.smartBooleans` switch
    when issued during compile-time for compile-time queries and during runtime for runtime
    queries.

    Additionally, in certain situations, it is far more preferable to express this without the `CASE WHEN` construct:
    ```sql
    SELECT ... WHERE ((...) && foo) || !(...) && foo
    ```
   This is because CASE statements in SQL are not sargable and generally [cannot be well optimized](https://dba.stackexchange.com/questions/209025/sargability-of-queries-against-a-view-with-a-case-expression).

 - A large portion of the Quill DSL has been moved outside of QueryDsl into the top level under the `io.getquill` package. Due to this change, it may be necessary to import `io.getquill.Query` if you are not already importing `io.getquill._`.


# 3.6.0-RC1

- [Fix Query in Nested Operation and Infix](https://github.com/getquill/quill/pull/1980)

# 3.5.3

Please skip this release and proceed directly to the 3.6.0-RC line. This release was originally a test-bed for the new Quats-based functionality which was supposed to be a strictly internal mechanism. Unfortunately multiple issues were found. They will be addressed in the 3.6.X line.

- [Adding Quill-Application-Types (Quats) to AST](https://github.com/getquill/quill/pull/1911)
- [Translate boolean literals](https://github.com/getquill/quill/pull/1923)
- [breakdown caseclasses in groupBy clause](https://github.com/getquill/quill/pull/1939)
- [allowed distinct to be placed on an infix](https://github.com/getquill/quill/pull/1935)
- [Change Subquery Expansion to be Quat-based](https://github.com/getquill/quill/pull/1920)
- [Use quats to expand nested queries in Spark](https://github.com/getquill/quill/pull/1932)
- [Fixed bug where alias of filter clause did not match alias of inner query.](https://github.com/getquill/quill/pull/1924)
- [Add default implementations so Query can be more easily inherited from Dotty](https://github.com/getquill/quill/pull/1879)
- [Monix streaming with NDBC](https://github.com/getquill/quill/pull/1750)
- [Fix SqlServer snake case - OUTPUT i_n_s_e_r_t_e_d.id](https://github.com/getquill/quill/pull/1867)

Migration Notes:`
 - Quill 3.5.3 is source-compatible but not binary-compatible with Quill 3.5.2.
 - Any code generated by the Quill Code Generator with `quote { ... }` blocks will have to be regenerated with
 Quill 3.5.3 as the AST has substantially changed.
 - The implementation of Quill Application Types (Quats) has changed the internals of nested query expansion. Queries
 with a `querySchema` or a `schemaMeta` will be aliased between nested clauses slightly differently.
 Given:
   ```
   case class Person(firstName:String, lastName:String)
   val ctx = new SqlMirrorContext(PostgresDialect, Literal)
   ```
   Before:
   ```
   SELECT x.first_name, x.last_name FROM (
     SELECT x.first_name, x.last_name FROM person x) AS x
   ```
   After:
   ```
   SELECT x.firstName, x.lastName FROM (
     SELECT x.first_name AS firstName, x.last_name AS lastName FROM person x) AS x
   ```
   Note however that the semantic result of the queries should be the same. No user-level code change for this
   should be required.


# 3.5.2

- [Add support jasync-sql for postgres](https://github.com/getquill/quill/pull/1793)
- [Add quill-jasync-mysql](https://github.com/getquill/quill/pull/1813)
- [Delete returning](https://github.com/getquill/quill/pull/1870)
- [Fix SqlServer snake case - OUTPUT i_n_s_e_r_t_e_d.id](https://github.com/getquill/quill/pull/1867)
- [Add translate to NDBC Context](https://github.com/getquill/quill/pull/1865)
- [Apply NamingStrategy after applying prefix](https://github.com/getquill/quill/pull/1807)
- [Remove use of `Row#getAnyOption` from `FinaglePostgresDecoders`](https://github.com/getquill/quill/pull/1848)
- [Better error message about lifting for enum types](https://github.com/getquill/quill/pull/1803)
- [More 2.13 modules](https://github.com/getquill/quill/pull/1753)

Migration Notes:
 - Much of the content in `QueryDsl` has been moved to the top-level for better portability with the upcoming Dotty
implementation. This means that things like `Query` are no longer part of `Context` but now are directly in the
`io.getquill` package. If you are importing `io.getquill._` your code should be unaffected.
 - Custom decoders written for Finagle Postgres no longer require a `ClassTag`.


# 3.5.1

- [Update monix-eval, monix-reactive to 3.0.0](https://github.com/getquill/quill/pull/1607)

Documentation Updates:
- [Update database drivers versions to latest in docs](https://github.com/getquill/quill/pull/1617)
- [Document remote debugging in IntelliJ](https://github.com/getquill/quill/pull/1615)

Migration Notes:
- Monix 3.0.0 is not binary compatible with 3.0.0-RC3 which was a dependency of Quill 3.4.7.
If you are using the Quill Monix modules, please update your dependencies accordingly.

# 3.4.7

- [Fix RenameProperties with Schema Re-Arrangement](https://github.com/getquill/quill/pull/1613)

# 3.4.6

- [Fixing Embedded Coproduct Column Duplication Issue](https://github.com/getquill/quill/pull/1604)

# 3.4.4

- [added MappedEncoding for encoding and decoding OffsetDateTime](https://github.com/getquill/quill/pull/1595)
- [Fix onConflict with custom schemaMeta](https://github.com/getquill/quill/pull/1589)

# 3.4.3

- [Nested Query does not work correctly with NamingSchemas](https://github.com/getquill/quill/issues/1577)

# 3.4.2

- [Fix NamingStrategy override of querySchema](https://github.com/getquill/quill/pull/1560)
- [Monix JDBC scheduling fixes ](https://github.com/getquill/quill/pull/1546)

Migration Notes:
- `NamingStrategy` is no longer applied on column and table names defined in `querySchema`, all
column and table names defined in `querySchema` are now final. If you are relying on this behavior to
name your columns/tables correctly, you will need to update your `querySchema` objects.

# 3.4.1

- [Fix property order expanded sub-queries](https://github.com/getquill/quill/pull/1541)

Migration Notes:
- Nested sub-queries will now have their terms re-ordered in certain circumstances although the functionality
of the entire query should not change. If you have deeply nested queries with Infixes, double check that
they are in the correct position.

# 3.4.0

- [Nest queries with infix values to allow infix-impurity](https://github.com/getquill/quill/pull/1534)

Migration Notes:
- Infixes are now not treated as pure functions by default. This means wherever they are used, nested queries may be created.
You can use `.pure` (e.g. `sql"MY_PURE_UDF".pure.as[T]`) to revert to the previous behavior. See the
[Infix](https://github.com/getquill/quill/tree/36842c4801c95a7609ba94c450645f3c022b3e2e#infix)
section of the documentation for more detail.

# 3.3.0

- [Fix join subquery+map+distinct and sortBy+distinct](https://github.com/getquill/quill/pull/1462)
- [Fix Java9 depreciation message](https://github.com/getquill/quill/pull/1504)

Noteworthy Version Bumps:
- monix - 3.0.0-RC3
- cassandra-driver-core - 3.7.2
- orientdb-graphdb - 3.0.21
- postgresql - 42.2.6
- sqlite-jdbc - 3.28.0

Migration Notes:
- The `returning` method no long excludes the specified ID column from the insertion as it used to.
Use the `returningGenerated` method in order to achieve that.
See the 'Database-generated values' section of the documentation for more detail.
- The `==` method now works Scala-idiomatically.
That means that when two `Option[T]`-wrapped columns are compared, `None == None` will now yield `true`.
The `===` operator can be used in order to compare `Option[T]`-wrapped columns in a ANSI-SQL
idiomatic way i.e. `None == None := false`. See the 'equals' section of the documentation for more detail.

### Migration notes

- `io.getquill.CassandraStreamContext` is moved into `quill-cassandra-monix` module and now uses Monix 3.
- `io.getquill.CassandraMonixContext` has been introduced which should eventually replace `io.getquill.CassandraStreamContext`.
- Spark queries with nested objects will now rely on the star `*` operator and `struct` function to generate sub-schemas as opposed to full expansion of the selection.
- Most functionality from `JdbcContext` has been moved to `JdbcContextBase` for the sake of re-usability. `JdbcContext` is only intended to be used for synchronous JDBC.

### Migration notes

- Sources now take a parameter for idiom and naming strategy instead of just type parameters. For instance, `new SqlSource[MysqlDialect, Literal]` becomes `new SqlSource(MysqlDialect, Literal)`.
- Composite naming strategies don't use mixing anymore. Instead of the type `Literal with UpperCase`, use parameter value `NamingStrategy(Literal, UpperCase)`.
- Anonymous classes aren't supported for function declaration anymore. Use a method with a type parameter instead. For instance, replace `val q = quote { new { def apply[T](q: Query[T]) = ... } }` by `def q[T] = quote { (q: Query[T] => ... }`

# 1.4.0

### Migration notes

- `quill-async` contexts: `java.time.LocalDate` now supports only `date` sql types, `java.time.LocalDateTime` -
only `timestamp` sql types. Joda times follow this conventions accordingly.
Exception is made to `java.util.Date` it supports both `date` and `timestamp` types due to
historical moments (`java.sql.Timestamp` extents `java.util.Date`).
- `quill-jdbc` encoders do not accept `java.sql.Types` as a first parameter anymore.

### Migration notes

- New API for schema definition: `query[Person].schema(_.entity("people").columns(_.id -> "person_id")` becomes `querySchema[Person]("People", _.id -> "person_id")`. Note that the entity name ("People") is now always required.
- `WrappedValue[T]` no longer exists, Quill can now automatically encode `AnyVal`s.

# 0.10.0 - 5-Sep-2016

**see migration notes below**

* [check types when parsing assignments and equality operations](https://github.com/getquill/quill/pull/532)
* [Update finagle-mysql to finagle 6.37.0](https://github.com/getquill/quill/pull/549/files)
* [Split quill-async into quill-async-mysql and quill-async-postgres](https://github.com/getquill/quill/pull/540)
* [cql: support `+` operator](https://github.com/getquill/quill/pull/530)

### Migration notes

- `mappedEncoding` has been renamed to `MappedEncoding`.
- The way we add async drivers has been changed. To add mysql async to your project use `quill-async-mysql` and for postgre async `quill-async-postgres`. It is no longer necessary to add `quill-async` by yourself.
- Action assignments and equality operations are now typesafe. If there's a type mismatch between the operands, the quotation will not compile.

# 0.9.0 - 22-Aug-2016

**see migration notes below**

* [new encoding, macros refactoring, and additional fixes](https://github.com/getquill/quill/pull/512)
* [Refactor generated to returning keyword in order to return the correct type](https://github.com/getquill/quill/pull/444)

* [Encoder fix](https://github.com/getquill/quill/pull/503/files)
* [enclose operand-queries of SetOperation in parentheses](https://github.com/getquill/quill/pull/510)

### Migration notes

* The fallback mechanism that looks for implicit encoders defined in the context instance has been removed. This means that if you don't `import context._`, you have to change the specific imports to include the encoders in use.
* `context.run` now receives only one parameter. The second parameter that used to receive runtime values now doesn't exist anymore. Use [`lift` or `liftQuery`](https://github.com/getquill/quill/#bindings) instead.
* Use [`liftQuery` + `foreach`](https://github.com/getquill/quill/#bindings) to perform batch actions and define contains/in queries.
* `insert` now always receives a parameter, that [can be a case class](https://github.com/getquill/quill/#actions).
- Non-lifted collections aren't supported anymore. Example: `query[Person].filter(t => List(10, 20).contains(p.age))`. Use `liftQuery` instead.
* `schema(_.generated())` has been replaced by [`returning`](https://github.com/getquill/quill/#schema).

* [fail compilation if query is defined outside a `quote`](https://github.com/getquill/quill/pull/433)
* [fix empty sql string](https://github.com/getquill/quill/pull/443)

### Migration notes

This version [introduces `Context`](https://github.com/getquill/quill/pull/417) as a replacement for `Source`. This change makes the quotation creation dependent on the context to open the path for a few refactorings and improvements we're planning to work on before the `1.0-RC1` release.

Migration steps:

- Remove any import that is not `import io.getquill._`
- Replace the `Source` creation by a `Context` creation. See the [readme](https://github.com/getquill/quill#contexts) for more details. All types necessary to create the context instances are provided by `import io.getquill._`.
- Instead of importing from `io.getquill._` to create quotations, import from you context instance `import myContext._`. The context import will provide all types and methods to interact with quotations and the database.
- See the documentation about [dependent contexts](https://github.com/getquill/quill#dependent-contexts) in case you get compilation errors because of type mismatches.
